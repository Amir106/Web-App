        <h1>LEAGUE OF LEGENDS</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The first game I really enjoy playinig is League of Legends.
             It is a really fun game to play online with your friends or alone.
             The game is played 5v5 on a map called Summoners Rift. The point of the game is to eliminate the opposite teams turrets
             and eventually destroy their nexus (the main point). There are over 140 characters which from you can choose, and there are 5 roles
             from which every one plays an important part. This game is based on teamwork and individual skill to outclass your opponent making you win the game.
        </p>
        <p>I have played this game since 2011 and have spent alot of hours on this game. Here is a analysis of time spent on one of my accounts</p>

        <p>As you can see there were much more productive things to do in this time but still I have no regrets as the game is really good and time consuming.</p>

        <h1>COUNTER STRIKE: GLOBAL OFFENSIVE</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The second game that I really enjoy playing is Counter Strike: Global Offensive. It is an FPS game which is also played 5v5 on many maps.
            There are 2 teams. The first team is Counter-Terrorist and the other team is the Terrorist team. The terrorist team needs to plant the bomb
            on one of the 2 sites which are on every map and survive to the detonation in order to win the round while the CT team needs to either prevent
            the Terrorists from planting or in the case they plant the bomb, they need to defuse it. The game is played in 30 rounds and each team
            is on one side for 15 rounds then they swap. The winner is the first team to gather 16 won rounds, in case of a 15-15 the game is over as
            a tie. The game is really enjoyable and I have made quite a few friends over it.</p>
