            <h1>League of Legends</h1>
            <p>The first game I really enjoy playing is League of Legends.
                It is a really fun game to play online with your friends or alone.
                The game is played 5v5 on a map called Summoners Rift. The point of the game is to eliminate the opposite teams turrets
                and eventually destroy their nexus (the main point). There are over 140 characters which from you can choose, and there are 5 roles
                from which every one plays an important part. This game is based on teamwork and individual skill to outclass your opponent making you win the game.</p>

            <h1>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h1>
            <p>The second game that I really enjoy playing is Counter Strike: Global Offensive. It is an FPS game which is also played 5v5 on many maps.
              There are 2 teams. The first team is Counter-Terrorist and the other team is the Terrorist team. The terrorist team needs to plant the bomb
              on one of the 2 sites which are on every map and survive to the detonation in order to win the round while the CT team needs to either prevent
              the Terrorists from planting or in the case they plant the bomb, they need to defuse it. The game is played in 30 rounds and each team
              is on one side for 15 rounds then they swap. The winner is the first team to gather 16 won rounds, in case of a 15-15 the game is over as
              a tie. The game is really enjoyable and I have made quite a few friends over it.</p>
